        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Lizbeth Ruiz; I am a first generation and first-year student majoring in Liberal Studies at the University of California, Riverside. I aspire to be an educator and UX Researcher. I currently reside in the City of Artesia, searching for research and educational experiences. I am bilingual in both Spanish and English. Overall, I'm an adaptive learner and great team worker; I hope to gain new mentors and connections. <br><br>

        As the oldest sibling, I grew up taking care of my younger siblings and at some point they claimed me as their ‚Äúmom‚Äù and not as their sister. I would make sure that they would wake up early for school, prepare their school lunch, and make sure that they were completing their homework on time. It wasn't that my mother was not around; I am just used to always offering help and so I never hesitated to do so. Taking care of my three siblings did not bother me at all; I enjoyed spending time with them. As I got older, I realized that I truly enjoyed working with children. I thought about different careers, such as nursing, dentistry, EMT, mostly medical fields. But none of the medical or healthcare careers satisfied me. I kept thinking about teaching and working with children. At the end, I decided to apply as a Liberal Studies major and hope to then get a teaching credential. I plan on becoming an Elementary Teacher and continue working with children. 
<br><br>

        Some opportunities that I have taken advantage of that have led me to pursue education and UX research are babysitting and volunteering at Long Beach Community Table. Long Beach Community Table is a non-profit organization that provides food, clothing, and products for the community. I began to volunteer at Long Beach Community in Summer 2021. I spent most of the summer packing and organizing the items and products that were being donated. I was able to meet new people and even made long lasting friendships. I spent so much time at the Long Beach Community Table that I began a project. I started off by thinking about a current problem and so the first thing that came to mind was ‚ÄúHomelessness‚Äù.I brainstormed and thought about ways to help the unhoused. As I completed my brainstorming project, I introduced it to Kristen Wilcox, who is the Ceo of Long Beach Community Table. Kristen approved the project and I began. I started my project by sending out flyers around my neighborhood and uploading a post on Social Media about my project, hoping to receive donations such as clothing, shoes, toys, basic essentials, etc. I ended up receiving over 6 large boxes of donations. I choose a date to drive around Los Angeles and Long Beach to feed the unhoused. The day of distributing food and donations came . . .I woke up early in the morning; I cooked about 300 tamales and made hot chocolate. We started off my driving around the city of Los Angeles, we fed about 130 in Los Angeles. I then drove around Long Beach and fed about 20 unhoused. Each person that received food was also able to receive clothing, socks . . . something they needed for themselves or friends. As I concluded my project, I realized how much I enjoyed helping and making changes for the people.
